### Members

### Invoices and the billing procedure

We create so-called Billing events in CrossLab for each invoicing period. This billing information is then imported into the university accounting system Agresso.  
In the invoice sent to you there will be a link address to the CrossLab pre-invoice. This link has the format https://eu.ilabsolutions.com/invoices/XXXXX, where XXXXX is the current invoice number.  
Click the "hamburger-"icon at the top left corner in CrossLab and then Invoices:

![3a_CrossLab_manual_GU_PI-023](assets/3a_CrossLab_manual_GU_PI/3a_CrossLab_manual_GU_PI-023.jpg)

Here you can view an invoice by clicking on the magnifying glass icon 🔎 to the right and export the invoice to a PDF file using the button Get PDF of invoices. Please, contact Ai-Linh Nguyen (ai-linh.nguyen@gu.se) or Lisa Månsson (lisa.mansson@gu.se) if you have any questions about accounting.

## Optional: CCI registration

This part has to be done by all microscope users. Therefore, if you, as a PI, only have a CrossLab account for the invoicing for your students, postdocs etc, there is no need to go through this registration. If you, on the other hand, will get training for using any equipment, please, follow these steps for the CCI registration procedure!

1. Go to the Request services (1) tab to fill out the CCI registration form, which is found under Registration Form for New Users (2) and click request service (3).  
![3a_CrossLab_manual_GU_PI-025](assets/3a_CrossLab_manual_GU_PI/3a_CrossLab_manual_GU_PI-025.jpg)
2. Fill out the form, print it (1), save it (2) and press submit request to core (3).  
![3a_CrossLab_manual_GU_PI-026](assets/3a_CrossLab_manual_GU_PI/3a_CrossLab_manual_GU_PI-026.jpg)
3. Sign the printed form, and bring it to us before the start of the training (or any other service).

## More information and support

You reach the Support Portal by clicking the Help button, next to the Sign out button at the upper right corner of the page.

Here you can also browse the help site (1) to get more information on how to use CrossLab, e.g. for equipment bookings and service request instructions. In case of technical problems with the CrossLab software can get assistance from the CrossLab Support Team by submitting a Support Ticket (2) where you describe your problem.
