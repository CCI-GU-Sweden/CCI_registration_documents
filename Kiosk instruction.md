# Instructions for *Kiosk*: Equipment logging system

The *Kiosk* is a web-browser tool that allows users of the CCI to track their equipment usage and to activate features of the microscope and image analysis computers that are otherwise not available. In a general way, the workflow we describe here is done during the equipment session and, therefore, is accomplished after the user has placed a reservation for the desired equipment via the CrossLab page.

## Start your session

    - For microscopes: Turn on the microscope and microscope computer.

6) Sign out of the CrossLab website.
7) If no user will work after you, then turn off the microscope or image analysis computer.

## Extend your session

You are allowed to extend your session if no other user has booked the microscope or image analysis computer. This can be done via the “Extend” button, which becomes available after your session is active for 30 minutes. The “Extend” button appears:

- directly under the “Finish” button (if you are on the detailed view)

![5_kiosk_instructions-012](assets/5_kiosk_instructions/5_kiosk_instructions-012.png)

- under the option arrow next to the “Finish” button (if you are back in the main “My Kiosk Sessions”)

![5_kiosk_instructions-013](assets/5_kiosk_instructions/5_kiosk_instructions-013.png)

The Kiosk will show allowed extension periods only, which differ depending on when the next user has booked the system. Select how long you wish to extend the session.

## Forgot to finish your session

It is critical that you remember to finish your session. If you forget to finish your session, then the system will assume that you have decided to extend your microscopy time. Therefore, your session will be extended until the session of the next user.

If you forget to finish your session and notice after you have left the facility, you have two alternatives:

- You log into the booking site of the CCI and stop your session via the *Kiosk*
- You immediately send an email to the CCI staff (cci@gu.se) to help you out.

Sincerely,  
The CCI Team
