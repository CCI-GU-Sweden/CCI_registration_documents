### Managing your group settings

It is advisable that you once in a while enter CrossLab and check that all your information is correct and that you have the correct group members associated to your lab. Press the “hamburger”-icon to the top left corner. Press “My Group” and select the group you wish to access the settings for (some PIs have more than one group, e.g. one GU and one SU group).

Under the Members tab (1) you can see the people, who are members of your group. You can either add a new user to your group or add a user who already has a CrossLab account (2). The status of a current member can be updated by clicking the edit button to the far right (3). For members who have left your group, please, set an end date to the membership (4).

### Entering/updating billing information

1. Go to My Profile link on the upper right corner of the page

![3c_CrossLab_manual_extern-012](assets/3c_CrossLab_manual_extern/3c_CrossLab_manual_extern-012.jpg)

![3c_CrossLab_manual_extern-013](assets/3c_CrossLab_manual_extern/3c_CrossLab_manual_extern-013.jpg)

3. Click the Edit button and enter your billing information

    - Name
    - Institution (University, company etc.)
    - Department: This should be the billing reference number and/or reference person (e.g. Ansvarsnummer, PO number)
    - Your full billing address, including VAT number

> **IMPORTANT!** Remember to click Save!

### Invoices and the billing procedure

We create so-called Billing events in CrossLab for each invoicing period. This billing information is then imported into the university accounting system Agresso. In the invoice sent to you there will be a link address to your CrossLab invoice. This link has the format https://eu.ilabsolutions.com/invoices/XXXXX, where XXXXX is the current invoice number.

Click the “hamburger”-icon at the top left corner in CrossLab and then “Invoices”.

![3c_CrossLab_manual_extern-014](assets/3c_CrossLab_manual_extern/3c_CrossLab_manual_extern-014.jpg)

Here you can view an invoice by clicking on the magnifying glass icon to the right and export the invoice to a PDF file using the button “Get PDF of invoices”. Please, contact Ai-Linh Nguyen (ai-linh.nguyen@gu.se) or Lisa Månsson (lisa.mansson@gu.se) if you have any questions about accounting.

## Optional: CCI registration

This part has to be done by all users of the facility. Therefore, if you, as a PI, only have a CrossLab account for the invoicing for your students, postdocs etc, there is no need to go through this registration. If you, on the other hand, will be trained for using any equipment, please, follow these steps for the CCI registration procedure!

1. Go to the Request services (1) tab to fill out the CCI registration form, which is found under Registration Form for New Users (2) and click request service (3)

![3c_CrossLab_manual_extern-016](assets/3c_CrossLab_manual_extern/3c_CrossLab_manual_extern-016.jpg)

2. Fill out the form, print it (1), save it (2) and press submit request to core (3)

![3c_CrossLab_manual_extern-017](assets/3c_CrossLab_manual_extern/3c_CrossLab_manual_extern-017.jpg)

3. Sign the printed form, and bring it to us before the start of the training (or any other service).

## More information and support

You reach the Support Portal by clicking the Help button, next to the Sign out button at the upper right corner of the page.

Here you can also browse the help site (1) to get more information on how to use CrossLab, e.g. for equipment bookings and service request instructions. In case of technical problems with the CrossLab software can get assistance from the CrossLab Support Team by submitting a Support Ticket (2) where you describe your problem.
