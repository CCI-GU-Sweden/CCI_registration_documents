## Connecting from outside the CCI firewall

You need to have an FTP client that can connect via FTP-SSL to be able to connect to the CCI file server. We recommend the following sharewares:

- Mac and Windows: [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
- Mac: [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)
- Windows: [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)

> **Note:** There are problems to connect using the Wi-Fi network called *GoteborgsUniversitet*. Use either a wired network connection or the Wi-Fi network *Eduroam*.

### Filezilla

1. Download the [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) client PC version
2. Save the installation file locally on your computer and install the program.
3. Enter the following details:
4. In the remote site window you will see the folder you have access to. Select a destination folder in local site window (i.e. your computer), then drag from the right window to the left and the transfer will start.

Login settings:

- *host address*: nas.cci.sahlgrenska.gu.se
- *port*: 22
- *server identity and password*
- Click *Quickconnect*

> **Note:** You might need to change the *Connect Mode* from *Default* to *Passive* under *More options*. If, like in the example below, the *More options* button is not displayed in the original window, try going to *Action* → *New Bookmark*. You will only see the remote folders. Navigate to files/user_folder. To download data either right-click on a file/folder or choose from the Action menu.

> **Note:** The first time you log in you might get a question about whether you trust the certificate.

When logged in, you see your local folders on the left and the remote folders on the right and it is possible to drag and drop between these two panels. Navigate to the remote folder “files” and then find the folder for your username. Please note that you do not have access to the other folders.
